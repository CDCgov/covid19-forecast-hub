This week's ensemble predicts that the number of new weekly laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 15000 nationally, with 8500 to 28000 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions likely reported in the week ending February 01, 2025.

Reported and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions as of January 15, 2025. This week, 9 modeling groups contributed 10 forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction.

The figure shows the number of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through January 11, 2025 and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through February 01, 2025.

The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
