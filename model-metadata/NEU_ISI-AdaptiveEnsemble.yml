methods: "An adaptive ensemble of multiple models contributing to the COVID Scenario Modeling Hub."
data_inputs:"Weekly incident flu hospitalizations, projections submitted to the COVID SMH"
methods_long: "The adaptive ensemble approach combines projections from the COVID Scenario Modeling Hub across all defined scenarios. The approach leverages new surveillance data points to generate an adaptive ensemble by dynamically rejecting the subset of individual models' trajectories that do not closely match the observed trends."
