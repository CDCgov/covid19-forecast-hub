designated_model: false
methods: "Baseline forecasting model using CDC's standard flat baseline approach via epipredict package. Uses most recent observed value as median projection with uncertainty based on historical timeseries."
data_inputs: "Epiweekly incident COVID-19 hospital admissions from the NHSN Weekly Hospital Respiratory Data dataset, https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Hospital-Respiratory-Data-HRD-Metrics-by-Ju/mpgq-jmmr/about_data"
methods_long: "This model implements the CDC standard baseline forecasting approach using the cdc_baseline_forecaster() function from the epipredict R package. The model projects the most recent observed value forward as the median forecast, with prospective uncertainty estimated from the preceding time series. This approach provides a simple but robust baseline for comparison with more complex forecasting models."
