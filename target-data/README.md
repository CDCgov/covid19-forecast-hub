# Target data
This folder contains the legacy version of target data used for the COVID-19 hospital admissions forecasting task [`covid-hospital-admissions.csv`](covid-hospital-admissions.csv), and a new version of target data in [standard hubverse format](https://docs.hubverse.io/en/latest/user-guide/target-data.html), [`time-series.parquet`](time-series.parquet) containing both hospital admissions and emergency department visits data. `time-series.parquet` contains the truth data for (eventual) evaluation of the forecasts submitted to the CovidHub.

## Hospital Admissions Data
The hospital admission prediction target `wk inc covid hosp` is the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions based on [NHSN Hospital Respiratory Reporting](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/psc/hospital-respiratory-reporting.html). [Weekly official counts](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Hospital-Respiratory-Data-HRD-Metrics-by-Ju/ua7e-t2fy/about_data) are publicly released on Fridays. [Preliminary counts](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Hospital-Respiratory-Data-HRD-Metrics-by-Ju/mpgq-jmmr/about_data) are released on Wednesdays. We update the target data files every Wednesday with latest values of incident covid-19 hospitalizations in the [target-data directory](target-data/).

## Emergency Department Visits Data
The emergency department visits prediction target `wk inc covid prop ed visits` is the weekly percent of emergency department (ED) visits due to COVID-19 based on [National Syndromic Surveillance Program](https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/index.html) (NSSP) [Emergency Department Visits - COVID-19, Flu, RSV, Sub-state](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/NSSP-Emergency-Department-Visit-Trajectories-by-St/rdmq-nq56/about_data) dataset.
